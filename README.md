Misc Projects
=============

This is a collection of miscellaneous projects that I've coded for fun, or as part of a non-academic assignment.

At the moment, it contains:

* An Android app to view headphones from Best Buy's Mashery REST API
* An iOS version of the above Best Buy app except with video games instead
* A few technical questions I've encountered in the past; some are made up; some are not.
