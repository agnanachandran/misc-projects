Since some of the models could only be in certain intervals. For example, current_amount is in intervals of 10000; it would be more space efficient to only store the current_amount/10000. So if a current_amount is 30000, the number 3 would be stored in the database. It could be converted back to the correct value when doing calculations or when displaying the data. For simplicity, I did not implement this idea.
